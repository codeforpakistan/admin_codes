# Pakistan Administrative coding
Coding all tiers of the state, from Provinces down to Union Councils

This is by no means indicative of how I want it, or how it should be. This is just the initial working, and is subject to change. In fact, I'm open to any suggestions that would improve upon the existing coding scheme or the structure. 

## Current state ##
The coding is almost complete up to Tehsil level, and is based on updates from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (http://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files/LIST%20OF%20DISTRICTS%20%26%20TEHSILS.pdf)

Province codes are based on ISO 3166-2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:PK). 

## Future ##
Ideally this list should be mapped down to Union Council, and hopefully linked to a low-poly map (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pakistan_Districts.svg).
