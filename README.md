# Pakistan Administrative coding
Coding all tiers of the state, from Provinces down to Union Councils

## Current state ##
* The coding is complete up to Tehsil level, and is based on updates from the [OCHA/WFP]([http://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files/LIST%20OF%20DISTRICTS%20%26%20TEHSILS.pdf](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-pak?)).

## Future plan ##
* Ideally this list should be mapped down to Union Council, and hopefully linked to a [low-poly map](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pakistan_Districts.svg).
